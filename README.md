# QA Platform
This repository contains a comprehensive Question and Answer platform built with ASP.NET Core and React. The platform allows users to ask questions, provide answers, create collections, bookmark content, and participate in communities.

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a clean architecture pattern with:

- Minimal API Endpoints : Using ASP.NET Core's minimal API approach
- CQRS Pattern : Command Query Responsibility Segregation for better separation of concerns
- Repository Pattern : For data access abstraction
- Fluent Validation : For request validation
- JWT Authentication : For secure user authentication

## API Endpoints
The API is organized into modules, each handling a specific feature:

- Auth : User authentication and token management
- User : User profile and permissions
- Question : Question CRUD and related operations
- Answer : Answer management
- Comment : Comment operations
- Bookmark : Bookmark management
- Collection : Collection operations
- Community : Community management
## Technology Stack
### Backend
- ASP.NET Core 9.0
- Entity Framework Core
- MongoDB (for document storage)
- Elasticsearch (for search functionality)
- Serilog (for logging)
- FluentValidation
- MediatR (for CQRS implementation)
### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- Axios (for API communication)
- React Router
- Form handling with FormData
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- SQL Server
- MongoDB (optional)
- Elasticsearch (optional)
- Node.js and npm
### Setup and Configuration
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure the database connection in appsettings.json
3. Run database migrations:
4. Start the backend:
5. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
6. Start the frontend:
## Development Guidelines
### Adding New Features
1. Create appropriate models in the Model directory
2. Add DTOs in the Dto directory
3. Implement repositories in the Repositories directory
4. Create commands/queries in the CommandQuery directory
5. Add endpoints in the appropriate module under Endpoints
### Validation
All DTOs should have corresponding validators in the Filters/Validation/Validators directory.

### Authentication
Endpoints requiring authentication should use the .RequireAuthorization() extension method.

## File Upload
The application supports file uploads (like community icons) using IFormFile and FormData:
```csharp
// DTO
public record CreateCommunityDto(string Name, string? Description, IFormFile? IconImage, bool IsPrivate);

// Endpoint
[FromForm] CreateCommunityDto dto
 ```

Frontend implementation:

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('name', name);
formData.append('description', description);
formData.append('isPrivate', isPrivate.toString());
if (imageFile) {
    formData.append('iconImage', imageFile);
}
 ```

No, the current implementation won't work with FormData from the frontend. The [FromBody] attribute expects JSON data, but you're sending FormData. Let's modify the endpoint to handle FormData correctly:

```csharp
public class CommunityModule : IModule
{
    public void RegisterEndpoints(IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints)
    {
        var group = endpoints.MapGroup(EG.Community)
            .WithTags(nameof(CommunityModule))
            .WithOpenApi();

        group.MapPost("/", CreateCommunity)
            .WithName("CreateCommunity")
            .WithSummary("Create new community")
            .WithDescription("Creates a new community with optional icon image")
            .DisableAntiforgery()  // Required for FormData
            .RequireAuthorization()
            .AddEndpointFilter<FluentValidation<CreateCommunityDto>>();

        // ... other endpoints ...
    }

    private static async Task<Results<Ok<CreateCommunityResponse>, ProblemHttpResult>> CreateCommunity(
        [FromForm] CreateCommunityDto dto,  // Changed from [FromBody] to [FromForm]
        [FromServices] IMediator mediator,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var command = new CreateCommunityCommand(dto);
        var result = await mediator.Send(command, cancellationToken);
        if (!result.IsSuccess)
        {
            return ProblemResultExtensions.BadRequest(result.Message);
        }
        return TypedResults.Ok(result.Value);
    }

    // ... other handlers ...
}
 ```

Key changes:

1. Changed [FromBody] to [FromForm] to handle FormData
2. Added .DisableAntiforgery() to allow FormData submission
3. Added endpoint metadata for better documentation
The existing CreateCommunityDto record already supports the form fields correctly:

```csharp
public record CreateCommunityDto(string Name, string? Description, IFormFile? IconImage, bool IsPrivate);
 ```

Now the endpoint will properly receive:

- name (string)
- description (string)
- isPrivate (bool)
- iconImage (file) from the FormData sent by your React frontend.
